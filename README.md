Test Coverage Analysis Challenge
============

This is the working version of the coverage analysis challenge. If you have any questions or need support for whatever reason, do feel free to reach out.

All documentation is provided in the form of Javadocs, which have been attached to this repository under /javadocs.

The project
============

This program was made with analysis in mind, and therefore rather than select random lines I created my tests based on methods within the program, as you typically expect to test methods during unit testing and analysis. This also helped to keep consistency between analysed lines even on restart of the program. With that in mind, in theory most lines should be unique to each test due to them being method specific, so that was taken into consideration when building the program.

I kept my Byte system in too, this was to show progression from version 1 of the program and my original thoughts, to the final product. The ByteClassLoader class is no longer in use, however, I have kept it in place and documented it anyway! I can explain the thought process if I achieve a final interview.

I look forward to hearing from you!
